# 🚀 coding-videocall: Where Code Meets Chaos (and Video Calls!)

## About This Wild Ride 🎢
This repo is a chaotic blend of modern web tech and real-time magic. It’s like building a house with legos, but the legos are also sentient and occasionally argue about CSS. Key features include:

- **Real-Time Chaos**: Video calls that might occasionally teleport you to another dimension (metaphorically speaking)
- **Authentication Theater**: Clerk handles user logins so you can focus on more important things
- **Database Gymnastics**: Convex does backflip data sync while juggling JSON
- **Chat Roulette**: StreamIO powers conversations that might accidentally include your cat (if you leave your camera on)
- **UI Illusions**: Shadcn components that look 3D but are actually 2D (don’t @ me)
- **Style Shenanigans**: TailwindCSS because who needs consistent design anyway?

## Tech Stack (A Frankenstein of Modern Web 🧟)
- **Next.js**: Because we love both server-side rendering *and* static sites
- **Clerk**: Authentication so simple even a sentient toaster could use it
- **Convex**: Real-time backend that’s faster than your morning coffee
- **StreamIO**: Chat that works even when your internet is plotting against you
- **Shadcn**: UI components that look like they were designed by a slightly tipsy UX genius
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling that’s 50% utility classes, 50% magic

Fun Fact 🎉
This app was built during a caffeine-fueled weekend where the only rule was "no rules". If you find any bugs, it’s probably a feature.
